There are few direct flights to/from Madison, but you might get lucky!\nAnother option is to fly into Chicago (O’Hare or Midway) and get a rental car. If you fly into O’Hare and do not want to rent a car, you can use the Van Galder bus to get between Madison and Chicago. Bus tickets are around $70 round trip per person."

If you find any new spots worth checking out, let us know!\n\nActivities\nOlbrich Botanical Gardens - Beautiful outdoor ornamental gardens that are free to the public. Or, if you’re looking for a tropical oasis, check out the Bolz Conservatory (tickets are $6, with free admission on Saturday 10:00 am to 12:00 pm).\nUniversity of Wisconsin Madison Arboretum - Sweeping open spaces representing a variety of native Wisconsin plant communities, in addition to curated horticultural collections.\nDane County Farmer’s Market - Expansive farmer’s market featuring Dane County-sourced fruits, vegetables, prepared food, and other wares.

Much smaller, less crowded, delicious breakfast and lunch food.\nHenry Vilas Zoo - What can we say, it’s a free-to-visit zoo in a quaint part of town!\nWisconsin State Capitol - Visit the location where we tied the knot: the Wisconsin State Capitol! It is beautiful inside, with gorgeous stonework, mosaics, and other exhibits.\nLakeshore Nature Preserve - An outdoor laboratory for UW Madison, the Lakeshore Nature Preserve has so many lovely views of Lake Mendota and various trails through diverse plant communities.\nWisconsin Memorial Union - The Memorial Union is a gathering place for the community. During pleasant weather, sit out on the Terrace, enjoy a beer, brat, ice cream cone (or all of the above!). It’s a relaxing spot to visit, but beware that parking can be tricky!\nMadison Children’s Museum - Arts, crafts, things to climb on, rooftop gardens, and more. We went here with our nephews and had a good time as adults!\nGarver Feed Mill - Large, restored brick building containing a collection of shops and places to eat. The Feed Mill often hosts craft fairs and other fun community events.\nMonroe Street - Trendy walk with shops, bakeries, and restaurants.\nA Room of One’s Own Bookstore - Lovely local bookstore with a diversity of book genres, cards, games, and other gifts.\nExplore the neighborhoods - There are so many fun spots to walk and peruse in Madison.

Really good mixed drinks ($$$).\nCanteen - Cozy taco joint with delicious margaritas ($$).\nAhan - Amazing Laotian and Asian-inspired dishes with locally sourced ingredients. Like Mint Mark, the drinks are playful and fun to try ($$$).\nBandit Tacos - Tacos and coffee (and margs!) in an old train depot ($$).\nTip Top Tavern - Burgers, sandwiches, salads, and pub appetizers, along with traditional brunch food ($$).\nDexter’s Pub - Fun Wisconsin sports bar with delicious Friday Night Fish Fry ($$).\nMolten Monkey - Detroit-style pies with a variety of adventurous flavors ($$).\nLola’s Hi-Lo Lounge - Walk into the doors of Lola’s on the Northside and be transported to another time. It’s like…a chic diner with nightly DJ’s that spin everything from jazz to punk to Motown ($$).\nAncora - Delicious spot for breakfast and lunch, with multiple locations across town ($).\nThere are so many more, we just don’t have the time or space to list them all."
