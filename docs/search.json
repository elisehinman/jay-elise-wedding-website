We are excited to see you at our evening shindig on Saturday, October 4th, 2025 at the Warner Park Community Recreation Center on our beloved Northside Madison.\nPlease Note: We‚Äôve had to change both the date and location of our celebration (if you‚Äôre looking at the ‚ÄúSave the Date‚Äù). It was beyond us that we were playing with fire picking a date before the University of Wisconsin Madison football home game schedule was released ü¶°. October 18th will be a face-off with the Ohio State University at UW Madison‚Äôs Camp Randall Stadium, and hotels are already gone/insane. Hoping this doesn‚Äôt through a wrench in your plans!\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at elise.hinman@gmail.com"

There are few direct flights to/from Madison, but you might get lucky!\nAnother option is to fly into Chicago (O‚ÄôHare or Midway) and get a rental car. If you fly into O‚ÄôHare and do not want to rent a car, you can use the Van Galder bus to get between Madison and Chicago. Bus tickets are around $70 round trip per person."

It‚Äôs prudent to bring layers because early fall in Madison can be a bit variable, but we‚Äôll have ample indoor space in case the weather is cool/disagreeable. We will have yard games set up, so if you‚Äôd like to participate, wear clothes that are easy to move around in.\n\n\n\nDevil‚Äôs Lake forest"
