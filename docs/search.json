If you find any new spots worth checking out, let us know!\n\nActivities\nOlbrich Botanical Gardens - Beautiful outdoor ornamental gardens that are free to the public. Or, if you’re looking for a tropical oasis, check out the Bolz Conservatory (tickets are $6, with free admission on Saturday 10:00 am to 12:00 pm).\nUniversity of Wisconsin Madison Arboretum - Sweeping open spaces representing a variety of native Wisconsin plant communities, in addition to curated horticultural collections.\nDane County Farmer’s Market - Expansive farmer’s market featuring Dane County-sourced fruits, vegetables, prepared food, and other wares.
